# Introduction to the Local Environment Setup Instructions

We believe that it's important for each student to have confidence in creating
code on their own computers. Many of our lessons also include feedback in the
form of code tests - these will only run in an environment set up for JavaScript
and Python. For these reasons, we ask students to set up their local environments
as early as possible. The next set of lessons will walk through the installing
and configuring the tools you'll need. Separate instructions are provided for
Mac and Windows users.

Local environment setup may take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours total depending on
how fast your computer is and your internet speeds. As you have time throughout
the week, try to install each of the tools and technologies listed in the setup
instructions and write down any issues that you run into. It is okay to install
the programs over the course of a few days.

> **NOTE**: If you are using a Mac then you will work through the steps in the
> **MacOS Environment Setup** module and ignore the Windows set up. If you will
> be using a Windows-based PC then you can skip past the Mac set up and work
> through the steps in the **Windows Environment Setup** module.
